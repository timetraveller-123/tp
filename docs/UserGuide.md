## Glossary

### Person

For the entire user guide the term person is used to refer to the patient of which the pharmacist is addressing to.
Persons are the people with whom you track your Orders and information for. To create an order with a person, they must first have been added to the app.

A person has the following attributes:
- Name
- Phone number
- Email Address
- Address
- Allergy(If the person has one)

Persons are uniquely identified by their names. No two persons can have the same name and names are case-insensitive.

### Order

Orders are event in which an order has been placed for a single or multiple medication for a certain person in the person list.

An Order has the following attributes:
- Order Number
- Person (Who the order belongs to)
- Medicine (What is in the order)
- Status of the order

Orders are uniquely identified by their order numbers. No two orders can have the same order number. 
No orders containing the medicine that the person is allergy to can be added without a special flag.
Orders will automatically tag under the <span style="color: red;">PENDING</span>
Status when added.

### Status

Status are used to describe the process at which the order is at.
Status can only be updated/modified following their chronological order.

<span style="background-color: red; border-radius: 20%; padding: 1px;">PENDING/PD</span>
->
<span style="background-color: blue; border-radius: 20%; padding: 1px;">PREPARING/PR</span>
->
<span style="background-color: green; border-radius: 20%; padding: 1px;">COMPLETED/CP</span>
->
<span style="background-color: black; border-radius: 20%; padding: 1px;">CANCELED/CC</span>

Status can be identified either in their full form or in their short form as shown above (FullForm/ShortForm). Status are all case-insensitive as well.

### Medicine

Medicine are objects that can be added to an order when it is being placed for a person.

A Medicine has the following attribute:
- Full Name of the medication
- A optional short form for the medication

Medicine are uniquely identified by their full and short form names. No two medicine can have the same names.

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `PharmHub.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your PharmHub.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar pharmhub.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

   Some example commands you can try:

   * `listp` : Lists all people.

   * `addp n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a person named `John Doe` to PharmHub.

   * `deletep 3` : Deletes the 3rd patient shown in the current list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addp n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addp n/John Doe`.  
* Spaces before and after parameter will be ignored.  
  If there is more than one space in between words in the parameter, it will be trimmed to one space.  
  e.g `addp n/ Alex Yeoh` will produce the same result as `addp n/ Alex     Yeoh`
* To input a `/` character in parameter, use another `/` before it.  
  If there is an odd number of `/`, one of them will be ignored.  
  e.g To input `Roy s/o Balakrishnan`, use `Roy s//o Balakrishnan`

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous PharmHub home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
