## Definition
This section provides an introduction to the terminology used in this user guide. 

### Person

For the entire user guide the term person is used to refer to the patient of which the pharmacist is addressing.
Persons are the people with whom you track your Orders and information for.   
To create an order with a person, they must first have been added to the app.

A person has the following attributes:
- Name
- Phone number
- Email Address
- Address
- Allergy(If the person has one. Can be one or more)
- Tag(Optional for additional remarks/inputs for the person)

A person is uniquely identified by their name. No two persons can have the same name and names are case-insensitive.

### Order

An order refers to a purchase of one or more medicines by a particular person in the person list.

An Order has the following attributes:
- Order Number
- Person (Who the order belongs to)
- Medicine (What is in the order. Can be one or more)
- Status of the order

Orders are uniquely identified by their order numbers. No two orders can have the same order number.   
No order containing a medicine that the person is allergic to can be added without a special flag.  
Orders will automatically tag under the <span style="color: red;">PENDING</span>
Status when added.

### Status

Status is used to describe the process at which the order is at.
Status can only be updated/modified following their chronological order.

<span style="background-color: red; border-radius: 20%; padding: 1px; color: white">PENDING/PD</span>
->
<span style="background-color: blue; border-radius: 20%; padding: 1px; color: white">PREPARING/PR</span>
->
<span style="background-color: green; border-radius: 20%; padding: 1px; color: white">COMPLETED/CP</span>
->
<span style="background-color: black; border-radius: 20%; padding: 1px; color: white">CANCELED/CC</span>

Status can be identified either in their full form or in their short form as shown above (FullForm/ShortForm). Status are all case-insensitive as well.

### Medicine

Medicine are objects that can be added to an order when it is being placed for a person.

A Medicine has the following attribute:
- Full Name of the medication
- An optional short form for the medication

Medicines are uniquely identified by their full and short form names. No two medicine can have the same names.

### Index

Many commands rely on index for execution. Index refers to the numbering in the last shown person/order/medicine list.
All indices have to be positive integers.

As you can refer to the image below index 1 refer to OrderNumber #1 while index 3 refer to OrderNumber #5.

![listp](images/listo.png)

Note: The Index will be based on the command being called and not the displayed list, 
if a command of viewp(view person) is being called, 
the index taken will be based on the person list and not this list being shown currently.

### Fields
* Fields are the different parts of a command.  
e.g. in `editp 1 n/Alex no/penicillin`, there are four fields. Namely, `editp`, `1`, `Alex`, `penicilllin`.    
* Spaces before and after fields will be ignored.
If there are multiple spaces between two words in fields, only one space would be retained.  
As such `Alex Yeoh` will produce the same result as `Alex     Yeoh`  
* To input a `/` character in a field, use another `/` before it.   
If there is an odd  number of consecutive `/`, one of them will be ignored.  
  e.g To input `Roy s/o Balakrishnan`, use `Roy s//o Balakrishnan`

The following fields are used for commands:

| Field         | Prefix | Format                                                                                                        | Example                                    |

* Shorthands can be used in replacement of the full names of the statuses

Example: 
* `updates 1 s/completed`
* `updates 1 s/COMPLETED`
* `updates 1 s/cp`
* `updates 1 s/CP`

### Filtering/Finding Order by status and medicines: `findo`

Finds orders whose status and medicine satisfies both inputs.

Format: `findo s/STATUS m/MEDICINE_NAME [m/MEDICINE_NAME]…`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `PANADOL` will match `Panadol`, `COMPLETED` or `CP` will match `Completed`.
* User input can find orders base on either status or medicines or both(but both will have to be satisfied).
* Status can only be `Pending/PD Preparing/PR Completed/CP Cancelled/CC`, any other inputs will be invalid.
* Medicine can be written both in their short form and full form. `pan` will match `Panadol`.
* Multiple Medicine can be used as input separated by a blank space but only one status can be used.
* Orders that contain any one of the medication/Status will be shown.

Examples:
* `findo m/Panadol Ibuprofen` returns any orders with either `Panadol` or `Ibuprofen`.
* `findo s/pd m/Panadol` returns any orders that is both `Pending` and contains `Panadol`.

### Deleting an order : `deleteo` 

Deletes the specified order from PharmHub.

Format: `deleteo INDEX`

Example: `deleteo 2`


### Undoing an action : `undo` 

Undoes the last data-modifying action.

Format: `undo`

* Limited to last 30 actions.
* Does not undo Ui views (eg. find, view commands). 

Example: 
* `addp` -> `listp` -> `undo` will undo the `addp` command

### Redoing an action (after an undo) : `redo` 

Negates the effect of the last undo.

Format: `redo`

* The undo command must have been the latest data-modifying command.
* Once a non-`undo` data-modifying command is executed, redoing undoes before that non-`undo` command is no longer possible

Example:
* `addp` -> `undo` -> `addp` -> `redo`  will throw an error
* `addp` -> `undo` -> `listp` -> `redo` will redo the `addp` command successfully



### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from PharmHub.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

PharmHub data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

PharmHub data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/pharmhub.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, PharmHub will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
